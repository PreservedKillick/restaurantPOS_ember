Lesson

** Make an app for restaurants to keep track of their customers' orders. **

* As a restaurant owner, I want to add tables to my restaurant, so that our servers can keep track of the bill at each table.

* As a restaurant owner, I want to add an item to our menu, so that our servers can note when a table has ordered that item.

* As a server, I want to choose a table and add an item to its bill, so that I can keep track of what the table has ordered.

* As a server, I want to see the total bill for a table, so I know how much to charge my customers.
